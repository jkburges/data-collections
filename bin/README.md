This directory contains (perhaps) scripts to:

* generate technology specific packages/folder hierarchies, e.g. the geoserver config directory structure, and/or synchronise collection definitions defined here with live systems via web APIs
* create placeholder config files for new collections (e.g. `bin/create_collection.sh <name> ...`)
